liblwm2m is an implementation of the LWM2M protocol from the Open Mobile Alliance.

Compiling
---------

Despite its name, liblwm2m is not a library but files to be built with an application. liblwm2m
uses CMake. Look at tests/server/CMakeLists.txt for an example of how to include it. 
Two compilation switches are used: LWM2M_CLIENT_MODE and LWM2M_SERVER_MODE.

Define LWM2M_CLIENT_MODE to enable LWM2M Client interfaces. Define LWM2M_SERVER_MODE to enable
LWM2M Server interfaces. Both can be defined at the same time.


Testing
-------

To compile the test server
 - - - - - - - - - - - - -

In the any directory, run the following commands:
    cmake [liblwm2m directory]/tests/server
    make
    ./lwm2mserver

The lwm2mserver listens on UDP port 5684. It features a basic command line interface. Type 'help' for
a list of supported commands.


To compile the test client
 - - - - - - - - - - - - -
  
In the any directory, run the following commands:
    cmake [liblwm2m directory]/tests/client
    make
    ./lwm2mclient

The lwm2mclient features two LWM2M objects:
    - Device Object (id: 3) containing hard-coded values from the Example LWM2M Client of
    Appendix E of the LWM2M Technical Specification.
    - a test object (id: 1024) with the following description:
                           Multiple
          Object |  ID  | Instances | Mandatoty |
           Test  | 1024 |    Yes    |    No     |
         
           Ressources:
                       Supported    Multiple
           Name | ID | Operations | Instances | Mandatory |  Type   | Range | Units | Description |
           test |  1 |    R/W     |    No     |    Yes    | Integer | 0-255 |       |             |
           exec |  2 |     E      |    No     |    Yes    |         |       |       |             |
    
The lwm2mclient opens udp port 5683. You can connect to it by installing the firefox plugin Copper
(http://people.inf.ethz.ch/mkovatsc/copper.php) and opening a new Firefox tab to: coap://[::1]:5683
At launch, lwm2mclient tries to register to a LWM2M Server at [::1]:5684. It features a basic command
line interface. Type 'help' for a list of supported commands.
